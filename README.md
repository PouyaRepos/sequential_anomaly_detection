## Introduction

The prompt and accurate detection of rare events is a critical challenge across various real-world domains due to the potentially severe consequences of such events. Examples include financial market crashes, power grid failures, cybersecurity breaches, early detection of rare diseases, and issues encountered by autonomous systems...

## Realizable and Noisy Cases

This work compares the performance of realizable and noisy cases in rare event detection...

### Realizable Case

Most active learning approaches assume data is perfectly separable...

### Noisy Case

A realistic scenario arises when the assumptions of the realizable case are relaxed...

### Version Space

In Active Learning, a key concept is the *version space*, which plays a critical role...

### Label Complexity

Label complexity reflects the number of labeled data points required...
